            <h4>The Rows</h4>
            <p>The Rows range pays tribute to the origin story and birthplace of the grapes used to craft them. We believe it’s important that our wines capture an essence of ‘place’, with each vintage representative of the ‘terroir’ of each region and vineyard. We're exceptionally proud of the hard work and passion that goes into making these wines, both in the winery and in the vineyards where everything begins. The Roots number represents the specific vineyard rows where these wines were conceived, with each collection a cycle that represents the end of one variety and the start of another.</p>
